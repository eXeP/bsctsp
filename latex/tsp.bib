abstract = "This paper describes an implementation of the Lin–Kernighan heuristic, one of the most successful methods for generating optimal or near-optimal solutions for the symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP). Computational tests show that the implementation is highly effective. It has found optimal solutions for all solved problem instances we have been able to obtain, including a 13,509-city problem (the largest non-trivial problem instance solved to optimality today)."

abstract = {The relationship between the symmetric traveling-salesman problem and the minimum spanning tree problem yields a sharp lower bound on the cost of an optimum tour. An efficient iterative method for approximating this bound closely from below is presented. A branch-and-bound procedure based upon these considerations has easily produced proven optimum solutions to all traveling-salesman problems presented to it, ranging in size up to sixty-four cities. The bounds used are so sharp that the search trees are minuscule compared to those normally encountered in combinatorial problems of this type.},

    abstract = { The traveling-salesman problem is a generalized form of the simple problem to find the smallest closed loop that connects a number of points in a plane. Efforts in the past to find an efficient method for solving it have met with only partial success. The present paper describes a method of solution that has the following properties (a) It is applicable to both symmetric and asymmetric problems with random elements (b) It does not use subjective decisions, so that it can be completely mechanized (c) It is appreciably faster than any other method proposed (d) It can be terminated at any point where the solution obtained so far is deemed sufficiently accurate. }

abstract = {Graphics Processor Units are used for many general purpose processing due to high compute power available on them. Regular, data-parallel algorithms map well to the SIMD architecture of current GPU. Irregular algorithms on discrete structures like graphs are harder to map to them. Efficient data-mapping primitives can play crucial role in mapping such algorithms onto the GPU. In this paper, we present a minimum spanning tree algorithm on Nvidia GPUs under CUDA, as a recursive formulation of Bor\r{u}vka's approach for undirected graphs. We implement it using scalable primitives such as scan, segmented scan and split. The irregular steps of supervertex formation and recursive graph construction are mapped to primitives like split to categories involving vertex ids and edge weights. We obtain 30 to 50 times speedup over the CPU implementation on most graphs and 3 to 10 times speedup over our previous GPU implementation. We construct the minimum spanning tree on a 5 million node and 30 million edge graph in under 1 second on one quarter of the Tesla S1070 GPU.},

abstract = {This paper discusses a highly effective heuristic procedure for generating optimum and near-optimum solutions for the symmetric traveling-salesman problem. The procedure is based on a general approach to heuristics that is believed to have wide applicability in combinatorial optimization problems. The procedure produces optimum solutions for all problems tested, "classical" problems appearing in the literature, as well as randomly generated test problems, up to 110 cities. Run times grow approximately as n2; in absolute terms, a typical 100-city problem requires less than 25 seconds for one case GE635, and about three minutes to obtain the optimum with above 95 per cent confidence.},
